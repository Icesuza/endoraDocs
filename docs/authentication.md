# Authentication & Security

Secure your API endpoints with Endora's comprehensive authentication and security features.

## üìπ Authentication Overview

:::info Video Demo: Authentication Setup
**Replace this placeholder with your authentication demonstration**

Learn how to set up and manage authentication for your API endpoints.
:::

## üîê API Key Authentication

Endora uses API key authentication to secure your endpoints. This ensures only authorized users can access your data.

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to your project settings
2. **API Keys Section**: Click on "API Keys" in the sidebar
3. **Generate New Key**: Click "Generate New API Key"
4. **Copy and Store**: Securely store your API key

:::warning **Keep Your API Key Secure**
Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control. Use environment variables in production.

:::

## üìπ API Key Management

:::

### API Key Features

- **Unique Keys**: Each project gets a unique API key
- **Key Rotation**: Regenerate keys for enhanced security
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API key usage and requests
- **Revocation**: Instantly revoke compromised keys

## üîí Security Features

### Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse with built-in rate limiting:

- **Free Tier**: 100 requests per hour
- **Pro Tier**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom rate limits

### CORS Configuration

Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web applications:

```javascript
// Example CORS configuration
{
  "allowed_origins": ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://app.yourdomain.com"],
  "allowed_methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
  "allowed_headers": ["Authorization", "Content-Type"]
}
```

## üìπ Security Configuration

:::info Video Demo: Security Settings
**Replace this placeholder with your security configuration demonstration**

Configure advanced security settings for your API endpoints.
:::

### Input Validation

All API endpoints include automatic input validation:

- **Data Type Validation**: Ensure correct data types
- **Required Field Validation**: Enforce mandatory fields
- **Format Validation**: Validate email, URL, and other formats
- **Length Validation**: Enforce string length limits
- **Range Validation**: Validate numeric ranges

### SQL Injection Prevention

Protect against SQL injection attacks:

- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use prepared statements
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic sanitization of user inputs
- **Query Validation**: Validate and escape all database queries

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Security

### IP Whitelisting

Restrict API access to specific IP addresses:

```json
{
  "allowed_ips": ["192.168.1.100", "10.0.0.0/8", "203.0.113.0/24"]
}
```

### Request Signing

For enhanced security, use request signing:

```javascript
// Example request signing
const crypto = require("crypto");
const secret = "your-secret-key";
const timestamp = Date.now();
const payload = JSON.stringify(data);
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update(timestamp + payload)
  .digest("hex");
```

## üìπ Monitoring and Analytics

:::info Video Demo: Security Monitoring
**Replace this placeholder with your monitoring demonstration**

Monitor security events and track API usage patterns.
:::

### Security Monitoring

Track security-related events:

- **Failed Authentication**: Monitor failed login attempts
- **Suspicious Activity**: Detect unusual access patterns
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Track rate limit breaches
- **Error Monitoring**: Monitor API errors and exceptions

### Analytics Dashboard

View comprehensive analytics:

- **Request Volume**: Track API usage over time
- **Response Times**: Monitor API performance
- **Error Rates**: Identify and resolve issues
- **Geographic Distribution**: See where requests come from

## üîß Best Practices

### API Key Security

:::tip **Use Environment Variables**
Store API keys in environment variables, never in code:

```bash
# .env file
ENDORA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

:::

:::tip **Rotate Keys Regularly**
Change your API keys periodically for enhanced security.

:::

:::tip **Monitor Usage**
Keep an eye on your API usage to detect unauthorized access.

:::

### Request Security

:::tip **Use HTTPS**
Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.

:::

:::tip **Validate Inputs**
Validate all inputs on both client and server side.

:::

:::tip **Implement Logging**
Log security events for monitoring and debugging.

:::

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If Your API Key is Compromised

1. **Immediately Revoke**: Go to settings and revoke the compromised key
2. **Generate New Key**: Create a new API key
3. **Update Applications**: Update all applications with the new key
4. **Monitor Activity**: Check logs for suspicious activity
5. **Review Access**: Audit who had access to the old key

### Security Checklist

- ‚úÖ API keys are stored securely
- ‚úÖ HTTPS is enabled in production
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting is configured
- ‚úÖ Input validation is enabled
- ‚úÖ CORS is properly configured
- ‚úÖ Monitoring is set up
- ‚úÖ Regular security audits are performed

## üìû Security Support

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Report Privately**: Email security@endora.space
2. **Provide Details**: Include steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Wait for Response**: Allow time for investigation
4. **Follow Guidelines**: Follow responsible disclosure practices

## üéØ Next Steps

After securing your API:

1. **Test Security**: Verify all security features work correctly
2. **Monitor Usage**: Set up monitoring and alerts
3. **Document Access**: Keep track of who has API access
4. **Regular Audits**: Perform regular security reviews
