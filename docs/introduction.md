# Introduction

Welcome to our web platform — a powerful and intuitive tool designed to simplify the process of building APIs from scratch. Traditionally, creating a backend API requires extensive coding, understanding database schemas, and configuring multiple endpoints manually. Our platform eliminates these challenges by providing a visual schema builder that allows you to define your database structure quickly and efficiently.
With this tool, you can create tables, define fields, and establish relationships between entities — all through a user-friendly interface. Once your schema is ready, our system automatically generates a fully functional REST API, complete with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints. You can immediately test the API within the platform or export it for use in Postman, your applications, or other development environments.

# Features

* Schema Builder : create tables, columns, and relationships.
* API Generator : automatically generates endpoints for CRUD operations.
* Download / Export : export API for Postman testing or server integration.
* Custom Field Types : support for strings, numbers, dates, booleans, etc.
