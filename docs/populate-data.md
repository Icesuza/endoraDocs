# Populate Data

When creating your schema, you can assign default values to any column. 

After creating your schema, you can populate your tables with data in two ways:
1. Manually Insert Data – go to datasource tap and add records directly by filling in the fields.
2. Import from File – Upload a file (such as CSV or Excel) to bulk insert data into your tables. This method is perfect for larger datasets or when migrating existing data.
