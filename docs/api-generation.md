# API Generation

Once your schema is ready, simply click the “Generate Enpoints” button and the system will automatically create a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for each table in your project. 

After generating your API, the platform provides you with a list of CRUD endpoints for each table in your schema. Each endpoint includes its base URL. Click on “Export Collection” to download JSON file for postman testing.

Beside when you click on any endpoint, you’ll be redirected to our Swagger UI interface. Swagger makes it easy to test requests directly in the browser without writing extra code.

Before sending a request, users are required to enter their Authorization Key. This ensures that only authorized users can access or modify data through the API.
Once authenticated, you can:
    Test each endpoint with real input values.
    Instantly see responses in JSON format.
    Debug requests and confirm the API works as expected.
    This interactive testing experience allows you to confidently explore and validate your API before integrating it into your applications.
